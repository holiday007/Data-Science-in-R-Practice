# Support Vector Machine

SVM - supervised learning model, associated with algorithms that analyze
data and recognize patterns, used for **classification and regression**

An SVM model is a representations of the examples as points in space,
mapped so that the examples of separated categories are divided by a
clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped to
the established space, and predicted to belong to a category based on
which side the gap they fall on.

Imagine the labeled traning data below:
