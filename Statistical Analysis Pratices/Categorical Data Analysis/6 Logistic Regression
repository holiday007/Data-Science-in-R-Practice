- beta -> log odds ratio

- median effective level

Other summaries:
I change in (x) over observed range of x
I change in (x) between observed upper and lower
quartiles of x
I x distance between (x) = 1=4 and (x) = 3=4

- in terms of inference, score and likelihood is considered better approach

- Goodness of fit test

- Hosmer-Lemeshow Test

- deviance based test -> group data, requirements of expected values

- LRT for model comparision is equivalent to testing independence/homogeneity for I x 2 contingency tables

- Test for conditional independence by comparing the Z-only model with the additive (or the saturated) model.

- LRT -> small expected cell counts?
